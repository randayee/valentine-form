    <h1>Happy Valentine's Day, Kaye! ðŸ’–</h1>
    <p>Itâ€™s been 8 years, and somehow, I still love you. A lot.</p>
    <p>You, me, and Poppyâ€”our little team. We've built a life that's simple but pretty amazing, and Iâ€™m grateful for every day weâ€™ve spent together <span class="italic">(I especially enjoy the days when I stay over)</span>.</p>
    <p>This year feels like a big one for us. More travels, finding that house we keep talking about, and turning all those late-night dreams into real-life memories. I know whatever comes our way, weâ€™ll handle it the same way we always doâ€”<strong>together</strong>.</p>
    <p>Thanks for being my person, my partner, and the one who really makes me feel whole. I wouldnâ€™t want to do life with anyone else.</p>
    <p class="signature">Love you always,<br>Randall S.</p>
